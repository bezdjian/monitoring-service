Containerized application for adding and monitoring services by their URLs.

- Backend monitoring-service with Vert.x and RxJava3

- MySql Database
- Gradle build tool

== Things are done in this app.
- A user is able to add a service with URL and a name.
- Backend with CRUD solution.
- Added services are kept in containerized mysql database even if the backend service is restarted.
- Front end UI displays all the services, user can add and remove a service.

== Building and composing docker containers

[source]
----
docker-compose build --no-cache
----
*_No need for --no-cache if you are building for the first time_*


== Starting containers with docker compose

[source]
----
docker-compose up --build
----
*_No need for --build if you have not changed Dockerfiles in any of the services._*


== Test the application
There is a cool website called https://mock.codes[https://mock.codes] that returns different http status codes which can be a good way to test adding a service to receive status OK or FAIL.

- Add a service with url https://mock.codes/200
- Add another service with url https://mock.codes/500
- To test the polling services, you can edit one of the services with /500 to https://mock.codes/200 and wait for the poller update its status.


== More things could be done
- Swagger UI for the backend service.
- Loading indicator for the front end when loading the services.
- More backend tests.
